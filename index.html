                <p class="mainText mb-5">
                    Welcome to my portfolio. It is intended to showcase not only finished projects, but also my journey
                    and progress in building my web development skills. Many of these projects are part of the formal
                    cirriculum of the University of Richmond Coding Boot Camp. The program is fast paced and intensive.
                    It involves learning new concepts each week while developing projects to demonstrate past
                    learnings. The projects demonstrate various levels of sophistication which reflect the level of
                    learning at the time. They also conform to the grading rubric which governs many aspects of look
                    and function. Feel free to share your feedback, words of encouragement, or just connect with me via
                    the links below.</p>

                <h3 id="aboutHost mt-5" class="sectionHead mb-2">Why Web Development?</h3>
                <p class="mainText">
                    I have spent my entire adult life working with technology. My strengths include an inane ability
                    to quickly grasp its concepts, understand the many nuances, to articulate technical topics to
                    non-technical audiences, and to formulate solutions. These skills have proven to be very useful
                    and have afforded me opportunities to explore numerous roles. From operations to support, mainframe
                    to cloud, application administration to system design, I have amassed a catalog of
                    experience and broad base of knowledge across many technical disciplines.
                </p>
                <p class="mainText">
                    With such a variety of experiences, I have developed the requisite skills and the reputation of
                    a capable IT generalist. While the name sounds humble, individuals like this are essential to an
                    organization. It is often an IT generalist who bridges the gap between the deep subject matter
                    expertise and the tactile needs of project or initiative. An IT generalist can reach across knowledge 
                    silos to build and manage a coalition of talent.
                </p>
                <p class="mainText">
                    The challenge is there is no template for IT generalists. There's no degree, certification, or
                    standardized test to identify these people. It is difficult to advertise and actively pursue a
                    set of nearly intangible traits which enable someone to succeed while serving in this capacity.
                    As as result, almost nobody recruits for what they can't adequately define.</p>
                <p class="mainText pb-3">
                    After nearly three decades in IT, I felt it was time to develop depth in something. I wanted a 
                    a demonstrable specialty which would help qualify my experience.  It is that which prompted me
                    to explore web development.
